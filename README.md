# IPL Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analytics project on the Indian Premier League (IPL) using Python and popular data science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis covers various aspects of IPL matches, teams, players, and statistics.

## Overview

The project is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Ipldata.ipynb**: Analysis of IPL match data.
2. **Deliveries.ipynb**: In-depth analysis of delivery-level data.

## Data Source

The data used for this project is sourced from two CSV files:

1. `matches.csv`: Contains information about IPL matches.
2. `deliveries.csv`: Provides detailed information about each delivery in IPL matches.

## Key Queries and Analyses

The project addresses several important queries, including:

- Number of matches played in each season
- Teams winning by maximum runs and wickets
- Team-wise statistics (overall and in specific seasons)
- Impact of toss on match outcomes
- Player of the match awards
- Weather effects on venues, and more.

## Getting Started

To explore the analyses and results, follow these steps:

1. Open `Ipldata.ipynb` and `Deliveries.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells to run the code and visualize the results.

Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or any other Jupyter notebook editor installed to view and run the notebooks.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
